Our paper on *Indoor Positioning Using the OpenHPS Framework* was presented today at the 11th International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation at Lloret de Mar, Spain. In this paper we introduce OpenHPS as a framework that is capable of handling an indoor positioning use case. We demonstrate this using a flexible and configurable process network that handles indoor positioning using existing techniques and algorithms. The flexibility of our framework allows developers to tweak every node in the process network to optimally sample the data.
