The creation of a positioning system has use cases for indoor, outdoor and even small-scale deployments. These solutions often use a broad range of technologies and algorithms that each have their advantages as well as limitations. Existing open source positioning solutions often offer a complete package for indoor navigation or asset tracking that allows developers to set up a specific application with minimal effort. However, these positioning solutions offer little room for developers to customise them.

Our OpenHPS framework was presented at the virtual FOSDEM 2022 conference where we focussed more on the technical aspect, as well as the open source collaboration oppertunities for nodes and services.
