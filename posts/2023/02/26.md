excerpt: "We have released OpenHPS v0.4 which adds new Web source nodes, better use of sensors and improved mapping to semantic linked data."
---

We have released the `@openhps/web-bluetooth`, `@openhps/web-sensors`, `@openhps/webxr` and `@openhps/web-geolocation` modules for OpenHPS in the monorepo [OpenHPS/openhps-web](https://github.com/OpenHPS/openhps-web) on GitHub. This repository will be used to contain future web modules that leverage the increasing power of the core Web API's for indoor and outdoor positioning via web applications. Developers will be able to use these modules right away to create web applications that can scan for Bluetooth beacons, compute dead reckoning using an accessible IMU sensor or even develop geomagnetic fingerprinting applications.

Web-based positioning has always been one of our main design goals since the early [alpha releases](/publications/2020/techreport) of OpenHPS in 2020 due to its interoperability between different operating systems and devices, as well as the large working groups that develop the API's that build the future of the Web. Many of the existing modules of OpenHPS are already compatible with web applications but can now access core APIs to access native sensors.

In September 2022 we presented a novel method to decentralise location data of users using semantic linked data. The paper can be found [here](/publications/2022/ipin2022/). We have since expanded the vocabulary of this publication in the [POSO ontology](https://github.com/OpenHPS/POSO) and implemented this in our `@openhps/rdf` component that enables serialisation of data frames and objects to semantic linked data. 

Our core framework (`@openhps/core`) has been updated to version 0.4 which facilitates the addition of sensors in regular `DataFrame`s. Before this release a custom data frame had to be created for different sensor data. For example, the `IMUDataFrame` was a data frame included in the `@openhps/imu` package that added the ability to send IMU sensor data to other nodes. Unfortunately, this method of adding sensor data did not scale very well.

## Sensors
In OpenHPS v0.4, sensors are created as `DataObject`s that contain their own spatial information and sensor values. By default the following sensors are available: [Accelerometer](/docs/core/classes/accelerometer), [LinearAccelerationSensor](/docs/core/classes/linearaccelerationsensor), [GravitySensor](/docs/core/classes/gravitysensor), [Gyroscope](/docs/core/classes/gyroscope), [Magnetometer](/docs/core/classes/magnetomter), [LinearVelocitySensor](/docs/core/classes/linearvelocitysensor), [RelativeOrientationSensor](/docs/core/classes/relativeorientationsensor) and [AbsoluteOrientationSensor](/docs/core/classes/absoluteorientationsensor).

```twoslash include example_sensor
import { DataFrame, Accelerometer, Acceleration } from '@openhps/core';

const frame = new DataFrame();
// Add an accelerometer sensor with uid "accelerometer" a default acceleration value and a frequency of 50 Hz
frame.addSensor(new Accelerometer("accelerometer", new Acceleration(
    1, 
    2,
    3
), 50));

// ...

// Get any sensor of a specific type
const sensor = frame.getSensor(Accelerometer);
console.log(`${sensor.value.x}, ${sensor.value.y}, ${sensor.value.z}`); 
// Expected output: 1, 2, 3
```
```ts twoslash
// @include: example_sensor
```

When needed, new sensors can be created.

```ts twoslash
// @experimentalDecorators: true
import { 
    SerializableObject, 
    LuminanceIntensityUnit,
    SensorObject,
    SensorValue,
} from '@openhps/core';

@SerializableObject()
export class AmbientLightSensor extends SensorObject<SensorValue<LuminanceIntensityUnit>> {
    constructor(uid?: string, value?: SensorValue<LuminanceIntensityUnit>, frequency?: number, displayName?: string) {
        super(uid, value ?? new SensorValue(), frequency, displayName);
    }
}
```

## Semantic linked data
Since our presentations at IPIN2022 and ISWC2022 we have improved the serialization of location data to linked data. To demonstrate this we showcase serialization of our new sensor data objects to JSON and RDF.

```ts twoslash
// @include: example_sensor
// ---cut---
import { DataSerializer } from '@openhps/core';
import { RDFSerializer } from '@openhps/rdf';

const serializedJSON = DataSerializer.serialize(sensor);
const serializedRDF = RDFSerializer.serialize(sensor);
```
