On the 8th of November, PhD candidate Maxim Van de Wynckel will present our SemBeacon solution at the 13th International Conference on the Internet of Things. 

## SemBeacon Demonstrator Application
Our SemBeacon [demonstrator application](https://github.com/SemBeacon/app) was created using @openhps/core, @openhps/rdf, @openhps/rf and the capacitor modules @openhps/capacitor-geolocation and @openhps/capacitor-bluetooth.
