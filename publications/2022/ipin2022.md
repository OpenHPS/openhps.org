excerpt: 'Van de Wynckel, M. and Signer, B.: "A Solid-based Architecture for Decentralised Interoperable Location Data", Proceedings of IPIN 2022 (WiP), 12th International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation, Beijing, China, September 2022'
abstract: "In today’s technological world of privacy-conscious users, the tracking of individuals via different
positioning systems and services can be considered obtrusive. Furthermore, linking and integrating
data from these positioning systems is not always possible or requires the major effort of creating new
interfaces between systems. In this paper, we propose an architecture for the realisation of a decentralised
positioning system based on the W3C’s Solid platform specification. Using this specification, sensor data
as well as an individual’s location information is stored in secure decentralised data stores called Pods, that
are hosted by user-selected Pod providers. We demonstrate that these Pods do not only offer transparent
and interoperable data stores for persisting sensor data as well as processed location information, but also
aid in linking multiple positioning systems for high- and low-level sensor fusion. For indoor positioning,
this interoperability provides a way to offer users a single location-based service while also providing
additional semantic context for other positioning systems to improve their data output. Developers of
indoor positioning systems can store all data in a format that is readable, understandable and accessible
by any other system that their users might be using, enabling collaboration between researchers and
companies implementing these indoor positioning systems."
