abstract: "Discovering smart devices in the physical world often requires some
type of indoor positioning system. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
beacons are a well-established technique to create scalable lowcost positioning systems for indoor navigation, tracking and location awareness. While various BLE specifications aim to provide
a generic way to uniquely identify a beacon and optionally detect
its location, they are either deployment specific or do not broadcast enough information to be used without a proprietary database
containing the locations of installed beacons. We present a novel
BLE advertising solution and semantic ontology extension called
SemBeacon that is backwards compatible with existing specifications such as iBeacon, Eddystone and AltBeacon. With the help of
a prototype application, we demonstrate how SemBeacon enables
the creation of real-time positioning systems that can describe their
location as well as the environment in which they are located. In
contrast to Eddystone-URL beacons which were originally used in
Google’s Physical Web project to broadcast web pages of physical
objects, SemBeacon is a specification for broadcasting semantic data
about the environment and positioning systems that are available
within a beacon’s proximity using linked data."
