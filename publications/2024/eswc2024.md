excerpt: 'Van de Wynckel, M., Valadez, I. and Signer, B.: "FidMark: A Fiducial Marker Ontology for Semantically Describing Visual Markers", Proceedings of The Semantic Web - 21st International Conference,ESWC 2024, Hersonissos, Crete, Greece, 2024'
abstract: "Fiducial markers are visual objects that can be placed in the
field of view of an imaging sensor to determine its position and orientation, and subsequently the scale and position of other objects within the same field of view. They are used in a wide variety of applications
ranging from medical applications to augmented reality (AR) solutions
where they are applied to determine the location of an AR headset. Despite the wide range of different marker types with their advantages for specific use cases, there exists no standard to decide which marker to best
use in which situation. This leads to proprietary AR solutions that rely
on a predefined set of marker and pose detection algorithms, preventing interoperability between AR applications. We propose the FidMark
fiducial marker ontology, classifying and describing the different markers
available for computer vision and augmented reality along with their spatial position and orientation. Our proposed ontology also describes the procedures required to perform pose estimation, and marker detection
to allow the description of algorithms used to perform these procedures.
With FidMark we aim to enable future AR solutions to semantically describe markers within an environment so that third-party applications
can utilise this information."
