excerpt: 'Van de Wynckel, M., & Signer, B. (2025). OpenHPS: A Modular Framework to Facilitate the Development of FAIR Positioning Systems. Journal of Open Source Software, 10(110), 8113. doi: 10.21105/joss.08113'
abstract: "Positioning systems determine the location of people and objects using various technologies and algorithms. While GPS dominates outdoor positioning, indoor and smaller-scale systems often require alternative technologies for lower latency, higher accuracy, or greater efficiency. These systems are frequently developed as single-use prototypes with no standard data format, hindering reusability and expansion. OpenHPS addresses these challenges by providing a modular, graph-based framework for creating versatile positioning systems on multiple platforms. It supports a wide range of algorithms and enables extensibility through custom nodes for sensor fusion and algorithm integration."
