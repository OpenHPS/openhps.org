        In this paper we introduced OpenHPS and its use within the domain of indoor positioning.

        OpenHPS is an open source hybrid positioning system developed in TypeScript that can run both on a server, 
        embedded device, smartphone or even the browser.

            ### An Open Source Hybrid Positioning System
            - Any technology
            - Any algorithm
            - Any use case
            - Flexibile processing and output
                - Accuracy over battery consumption, reliability, ...
            - Aimed towards
                - Developers
                - Researchers

        With OpenHPS we aim to offer a framework for developers and researchers that
        can support a variety of positioning technologies, algorithms and uses cases that are not just
        limited to indoor positioning. We also aim to offer a lot of flexibility in the outcome of the position,
        weither it is a developer wishing to offer the most accurate position, power optimized solution or
        simply a reliable system that can rougly (but reliably) indicate weither or not you are in a specific room.

        When creating a positioning system, you obtain sensor data from multiple different sensors. You process the data until at some stage in your processing
        you merge the sensor data to obtain a position that you can show to your user.

        OpenHPS focuses on this method of developing a positioning system by allowing the creation of a process network with graph topology. 
        We identify source nodes that provide data, processing nodes that process this data and finally sink nodes that store or display this data. 
        We call this complete process network from source to sink a positioning model.

        <aside class="notes">
        On top of this, every node in our process network has access to a range of 'Services' that either manage the persistent storage of data that is being handled or
        handle background processing of information that is already pushed through the network. Each service can be added to multiple positioning models, allowing data
        exchange between the calibration part of a process network and the actual online stage used on a production ready system.

        <aside class="notes">
        By creating this process network design with shared services we allow for a very modular ecosystem where individual nodes or services
        can be reused throughout multiple different packages. Our core component offers the main concepts
        needed to design a process network for processing sensor data to an output position while other components
        handle the communication, data storage or add additional algorithms.
