            ## POsitioning System Ontology
            ### Introduction

            > POSO provides the terminologies needed to describe different **types of positioning systems**, the **algorithms** and technnologies
            that they implement and the **data** that is produced by these systems.
        {% endmarkdown %}

        <aside class="notes">
            To quickly introduce you to POSO, in this paper we introduce a new ontology that provides the terminologies
            needed to describe the different types of positioning systems and the algorithms, technologies and
            techniques that they implement. It also helps to describe the data these systems produce without loosing
            any information.

        <aside class="notes">
            If we look at existing semantic descriptions, spatial data is an important aspect to describe
            various spaces and the objects inside them and a lot of ontologies already exist that do exactly this.

            However, if we take a step back and we look at how this data was determined, we often see it was done using a
            positioning system or a location-based service that accesses a positioning system behind the scenes. 
            
            While a location-based service aims to provide you with a nice clean geographical location, maybe even with some
            additional context such as the accuracy. The system working behind the scenes has a lot more information. In addition we do not
            know how the output of a location-based service was computed.

            On the slide you see two similar output positions from two location based services. 
            For consumers of this data, the output has enough context to use it. However, for other positioning systems
            that want to use further compute or reason about the data there is a lack of information. 
            
            With POSO we aim to describe the process that led to a certain output, which in our case means the description of the system
            that works behind the scenes. Using this additional information another positioning system knows how to reason on
            the output or know how to perform high level sensor fusion.

        ## Methodology
        1. Design constraints 
        2. First basic prototype (IPIN 2022)
        3. Mapping of POSO to our framework
    {% endmarkdown %}

    <aside class="notes">
        Our methodology of the ontology design was based on our own generic positioning system named OpenHPS
        as well as existing datasets for positioning systems such as UJIndoorLoc or the ambient assisted living evaluation competition. 
        Our design constraints for the ontology that we designed were very similar to the design constraints of our framework.

        We created a first prototype for the Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation conference where we only used some of the core 
        ontologies. With the prototype we realised that there currently were no ontologies available to correctly describe a complete positioning
        system, which led us to create POSO.

        In order to test if the POSO ontology could represent all data that makes up a positioning system we mapped all the data types
        that we use in our positioning systems to RDF using POSO.

        <img class="fragment" width="70%" src="images/architecture.svg"/>

        <aside class="notes">
            When creating the design for our ontology we first identified what actually defines a positioning system.

            A positioning system is a system that aims to track entities in a certain area. These entities can be objects, persons
            or basically any spatial thing. We usually deploy this positioning system at the area where this tracking
            should be done. Weither it is on another planet, a building, an underground metro track or something more 
            abstract like tracking pawns on a physical game board.

            The system uses various different algorithms and technnologies that are used to
            track an entity. Each entity on itself has different properties, such their position,
            their orientation or velocity that are important for the algorithms to determine their
            position.

            - We presented the new **POSO** ontology
            - Allignment modules for specific types of algorithms
            - Interoperability between positioning systems

        In this paper we presented our Positioning System Ontology named POSO. This is a new
        ontology that we have slowly started to use

        We hope that POSO will help in creating interoperable positioning and navigation applications. Which could
        allow us to transition to a single interoperable application to navigate both outdoors, indoor or underground.
