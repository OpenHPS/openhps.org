            ## POsitioning System Ontology
            ### Introduction

            > POSO provides the terminologies needed to describe different **types of positioning systems**, the **algorithms** and technnologies
            that they implement and the **data** that is produced by these systems.
        {% endmarkdown %}

        <aside class="notes">
            To quickly introduce you to POSO, in this paper we introduce a new ontology that provides the terminologies
            needed to describe the different types of positioning systems and the algorithms, technologies and
            techniques that they implement. It also helps to describe the data these systems produce without loosing
            any information.

            If we look at existing semantic descriptions, spatial data is an important aspect to describe
            various spaces and the objects inside them and a lot of ontologies already exist that do exactly this.

            However, if we take a step back and we look at how this data was determined, we often see it was done using a
            positioning system or a location-based service that accesses a positioning system behind the scenes. 
            
            While a location-based service aims to provide you with a nice clean geographical location, maybe even with some
            additional context such as the accuracy. The system working behind the scenes has a lot more data available. In addition we do not
            know how the output of a location-based service was processed.

            On the slide you see two similar output positions from two real location based services. 
            For consumers of this data, the output has enough context to use it. However, for other positioning systems
            that want to use further compute or reason about the data there is a lack of information. 

            In this example it would show that the second location based service with a higher self-reported accuracy is the indoor positioning
            system, while the first location based service was the output of the geolocation api service with a wrong location and in this
            case also a wrong accuracy.

            A system or consumer that sees these two positions now has to decide the relevancy of each location - which without context
            would not always provide predictable results.

            With POSO we aim to describe the process that led to a certain output, which in our case means the description of the system
            that works behind the scenes and the complete set of data that is can produce. 
            Using this additional information another positioning system knows how to reason on
            the output or know how to perform high level sensor fusion. It may even be able to use additional
            data that is not important for the output - but can benefit another system.

            ## Positioning System
        {% endmarkdown %}

        <aside class="notes">
            When creating the design for our ontology we first identified what actually defines a positioning system.

            A positioning system is a system that aims to track entities in a certain area. These entities can be objects, persons
            or basically any spatial thing. We usually deploy this positioning system at the area where this tracking
            should be done. Weither it is on another planet, a building, an underground metro track or something more 
            abstract like tracking pawns on a physical game board.

            The system uses various different algorithms and technnologies that are used to
            track an entity. Each entity on itself has different properties, such their position,
            their orientation or velocity that are important for the algorithms to determine their
            position.

        We identified five main types of positioning systems based on existing ISO standards and in use systems. 
        A satellite positioning system such as GPS, Baidu or Galileo which is commonly used outdoors; 
        an optical positioning system that makes use of optical imagery to determine a position, 
        inertial positining systems that detect the movement,
        integrated or also called hybrid positioning system that combines other systems or various technnologies to obtain a result.
        Finally, we also define indoor positioning systems as a seperate category. While there is no ISO standard that
        distinguishes between an indoor positioning system and an integrated positioning system that is commonly used for these
        types of system. We added it as a type to more precicely identify this common type of system.

        <aside class="notes">
            Aside from being able to describe a positioning system, we also wanted to describe the data they produce
            in a way that would be usable by other systems.

            Historical data is important for many positioning systems, so one design criteria was definitely to allow 
            individual observations of a value. The most important types of data for positioning system is a position,
            orientation and velocity. But the ontology should still allow for extensions of other sensor data if needed.

            Finally, a system may provide a position with different granularities. For example, an indoor positioning
            system might be able to track your location in an office with 1 meter accuracy. But that would not mean that you want
            other systems or applications to know this accurate position. Or to give a more realistic example, you might have
            a simple system that knows your room based on a QR-code check-in system. The system can report that you are 'In'
            a certain room until you check out - but at the same time your system also knows that at the second you scan the QR-code
            you are standing right in front of it.

        <aside class="notes">
            We decided to use the Semantic Sensor Network Ontology together with the Sensor, Observation, Sample and Actuator
            ontology - or SOSA for short. Both act as the core ontologies for POSO and already offer the ability to describe 
            systems and their implemented 'procedures'. SOSA extends this with observable properties and observations of these properties.

            Our first contribution with POSO is the ability to classify what type of system we are dealing with.
            We have the five positioning systems that we discussed earlier and in addition we also have a location
            based service in case the underlying system can not be described in more detail - which could be the case
            in some systems that have a blackbox implementation.

        <aside class="notes">
            Next, currently at this point in time we have three main categories of procedures or algorithms 
            that a positioning system may use. Radio propagation algorithms that convert a signal strength
            to a distance, sensor fusion algorithms that describe how multiple sensor sources are combined
            and finally a larger category for every positioning technique that a positioning system may use.

            The full list of positioning technique types that are available in POSO can be found in the paper
            and the supplemental material, but in short it includes types such as different RF-based algorithms, 
            fingerprinting techniques, dead reckoning, odometry and simultaneous localisation and mapping

            POSO also expands the observable properties and observation results with
            position, velocity, acceleration and orientation.

            The position can be either an absolute or relative position similar to how many 
            existing work classifies the two different types.
            Both velocity and acceleration have two subclasses for linear and angular velocity or acceleration.

            Our decision to make these types of properties a subclass of both an observable property and a result
            was to allow static values.

        <aside class="notes">
            Finally, the SOSA core ontology offers the class 'Feature of Interest' which is defined as 
            'the thing whose property is being estimated or calculated in the course of an observation
            to arrive at a result.' We expanded on this by adding a tracked feature and landmark.
            Landmarks are an important aspect in positioning as they are the anchors in many different positioning
            techniques. We added a few basic types of landmarks to make it clear how we expect this type of
            class to be used. Mainly, auditory, visual and RF landmarks with a BluetoothBeacon being a subclass of RF landmarks.

            POSO on itself offers many other useful classes and predicates that can be used to describe
            a positioning system and its data such as additional stimulus classes for different types of movement
            that could trigger the update of a position. For more information, please check the supplemental material.

        ## Design Methodology
        1. Design constraints 
        2. First basic prototype (IPIN 2022)
        3. Mapping of POSO to our framework
    {% endmarkdown %}

    <aside class="notes">
        Our ontology design methodology was based on our own generic hybrid positioning system framework named OpenHPS
        as well as existing datasets for positioning systems such as indoor positioning dataset or the ambient assisted living 
        evaluation competition. Our design constraints for the ontology that we designed were very similar to the design constraints 
        of our framework - mainly allowing a large range of use cases both in 2D or 3d positioning, indoor, outdoor
        or something smaller like a table.

        After some initial experiments where we tried to describe a positioning system with existing ontologies
        We created a first prototype for the Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation conference where we only used some of the core 
        ontologies. With the prototype we realised that there currently were no ontologies available to correctly describe a complete positioning
        system, which led us to create POSO.

        In order to test if the POSO ontology could represent all data that makes up a positioning system we mapped all the data types
        that we use in our positioning systems to RDF using POSO.

        ## POSO Common Module (`posoc`)
        ### `http://purl.org/poso/common/`

        - Adds common positioning systems, algorithms and types.
        - Adds common types of landmarks (e.g. iBeacon, AltBeacon, ...)
    {% endmarkdown %}

    <aside class="notes">
        We envision POSO as the main ontology that describes different categories of systems, algorithms and techniques.
        But with the large amount of IoT, geospatial and domain specific ontologies available we want
        to add multiple allignment modules for POSO. One of the modules that we included in the paper is the poso-common module
        that includes individuals for different algorithms, existing satellite positioning systems, technologies, protocols and frameworks.

        This module can be used to describe the base of a positioning system, which is often comprised of multiple existing technologies
        and algorithms that are tweaked to solve a particular tracking goal.

            geosparql:hasGeometry [ 
                a geosparql:Geometry ;
                geosparql:asWKT "..."^^geosparql:wktLiteral ] .
         
        <system/OPS> a poso:LocationBasedService ;
            rdfs:label "Outdoor campus positioning"@en ;
            ssn:hasSubSystem posoc:GPS ;
            ssn:hasDeployment dbr:Some_University .

        <system/CampusPositioning> a poso:IntegratedPositioningSystem ;

            ssn:hasSubSystem  <system/OPS>, <system/IPS> ;
            ssn:implements posoc:WeightedAccuracyFusion .
        ```
    {% endmarkdown %}
    <aside class="notes">
    So let's give a simple example on how POSO would be used to describe positioning systems and their data. 
    Here you see three positioning systems.
    An outdoor positioning system that is actually a location based service using GPS behind the scenes.
    We use it outdoor throughout a univerity deployment.

    An indoor positioning system that implements a specific fingerprinting algorithm in a specified building.
    The building then contains information about its geometry which could be used to map it to geographical coordinates.

    And finally a single positioning system that is a hybrid system using both the outdoor and indoor
    systems. We describe this as two subsystems and we implement a simple weighted accuracy fusion of the output for both systems.

    Next, we have an observation of the indoor positioning system. Here we clearly mention which
    technique was used to obtain this observation. Other than the outdoor positioning system our result is
    an absolute position within a deployment. We assume in this example that the deployment has a coordinate
    reference system that can be used to map this cartesian coordinate to a geographical location if needed.

        In this paper we presented our Positioning System Ontology named POSO. This is a new
        ontology that allows you to describe positioning systems and their implemented algorithms as well as the
        data they produce.

        We included the poso common module that adds common algorithms and systems and will also be expanded in the future
        with more algorithms, frameworks and in use systems.

        We hope that POSO will help in creating interoperable positioning and navigation applications. Which could
        allow us to transition to a single interoperable application to navigate both outdoors, indoor or underground.

        Future work will definitely be done on additional allignment modules where we link POSO to other ontologies that already
        describe different types of sensors that are commonly used in these types of systems.

        Thank you for your attention.
