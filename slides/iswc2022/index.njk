            ## POsitioning System Ontology
            ### Introduction

            > POSO provides the terminologies needed to describe different **types of positioning systems**, the **algorithms** and technnologies
            that they implement and the **data** that is produced by these systems.
        {% endmarkdown %}

        <aside class="notes">
            So to quickly introduce you to POSO, it is a new ontology that provides you with the terminologies
            needed to describe the different types of positioning systems, the algorithms, tecnologies and
            techniques that they implement. And finally terminologies to describe the data they produce.

            ## Beyond Location-based Services

        {% endmarkdown %}

        <aside class="notes">
            If we look at existing semantic descriptions, spatial data is an important aspect to describe
            various spaces and the objects inside them and a lot of ontologies already exist that do exactly this.

            However, if we take a step back and we look at how this data was determined, we often see it was done using a
            positioning system or a location-based service that accesses a positioning system behind the scenes. 
            
            While a location-based service aims to provide you with a nice clean geographical location, maybe even with some
            additional context such as the accuracy. The system behind the scenes has a lot more information. In addition we do not
            know how the output of a location-based service was computed.

            ## The Problem of Missing Context
        {% endmarkdown %}

        <aside class="notes">
            For consumers of this data, the output has enough context to use it. However, for other positioning systems
            that want to use the data there is a lack of information.

        ## Methodology
        1. Design constraints 
        2. First prototype <small>(IPIN 2022)</small>
        3. Object Relational Mapping for RDF with the POSO ontology
        4. Positioning systems with automatic data output to RDF using POSO
    {% endmarkdown %}

    <aside class="notes">
        Our methodology of the ontology design was based on our own generic positioning system named OpenHPS
        as well as existing datasets for positioning systems such as UJIndoorLoc or the EvAAL competition. 
        Our design constraints for the framework were very similar to the ontology.

        We created a first prototype for IPIN 2022 where we only used some of the core ontologies.
        We quickly realised that more work on the ontology aspect was needed which resulted us in creating
        a dedicated module for our own positioning framework where we use the POSO ontology.

            ## Positioning System
        {% endmarkdown %}
        <img width="70%" src="images/architecture.svg"/>
        <aside class="notes">
        A positioning system is a system that aims to track entities in a certain area. These entities can be objects, persons
        or basically any spatial object. We usually deploy this positioning system at the area where this tracking
        should be done. Weither it is in space, a building, an underground metro or something more abstract like a physical game board.

        The system uses various different algorithms and technnologies that are used to
        track an entity. Each entity on itself has different properties, such their position,
        their orientation or velocity that are important for the algorithms to determine their
        position.

        <aside class="notes">
            If we take a look at a positioning system implemented on a mobile phone we see that the smartphone
            itself is the 'Sampler' with different sensors inside. The sensor data is processed by different
            positioning techniques until it outputs a property.

            ## Positioning System ...
            - Satellite positioning system
            - Optical positioning system
            - Inertial positioning system
            - Indoor positioning system
            - Integrated positioning system
        {% endmarkdown %}
        <aside class="notes">
        There are five main types of positioning systems. We identified these based on existing ISO standards. 
        A satellite positioning system such as GPS, Baidu or Galileo; an optical positioning system
        that makes use of optical imagery to determine a position, inertial positining systems that detect the movement , indoor positioning systems
        that were added to specifically identify a system that is used indoors as opposed as outdoors where satellite systems
        are often standard. And finally an integrated or also called hybrid positioning system that combines other systems
        or various technnologies to obtain a result.

            *A feature of interest that is being tracked by a positioning system. This is the feature for which a position is observed.*

            ## Conclusion and Future Work
            - We presented the new **POSO** ontology
            - Allignment modules for specific types of algorithms
            - Interoperability be 
        {% endmarkdown %}
        
        <aside class="notes">
        In this paper we presented our Positioning System Ontology named POSO. This is a new
        ontology that we have slowly started to use

        We hope that POSO will help in creating interoperable positioning and navigation applications.
